# Rekordbox Playlist Export To Folder
Rekordbox Playlist Export to Folder Script

- get music path file from *.m3u8 playlist export format and bulk copy to destination folder
- at RekordBox app, right click on playlist you want to export -> Export a playlist to a file -> for music apps (*.m3u8)
- run this script with Administrator level command prompt, so it can have access for copy paste to user dir (not necessary if just from usual local drive to usual local drive)
- it had shitty UI for picking a file and destination dir, but nevertheless works just fine for me
